                I am a 23 year old from Montserrat, and I love to play video games and code
                programs, apps and watch series and movies.
                My future aspiration is to be a software developer or an all-around IT/Computer Science specialist with
                a
                focus on programming/coding. I am studying
                for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at the University of The West Indies - Five Islands.
                I am interested in Web Development because I love to create and design things, and I also love to
                learn new things. I am excited to learn more about web development and to create more complex
                applications in the future.
